# AVP diagnostic inputs (decision 65)

Tools only: no client changes, third-party packages, ffmpeg, downloads or device installation.
Run from the repository root on a Mac with Xcode selected and an available HEVC encoder.
The two entry scripts share `clip-engine.swift` and invoke the system Swift interpreter.

```sh
swift tools/diag/make-hevc-clips.swift --out /tmp/avp-hevc
swift tools/diag/make-pq-clips.swift --out /tmp/avp-pq
```

Use fresh output directories. `--help` lists overrides: `--sizes WIDTHxHEIGHT,...`,
`--fps 90,120`, `--seconds 5`, `--bitrate 40000000` (bits/s).
Default stress matrix: 3840×2160, 5120×2880, 7680×4320, 3648×2912,
90/120 fps, five seconds each. Its moving luma ramps and bars change every frame.
Encoding runs as fast as the Mac permits; timestamps express the requested cadence,
not a measurement of Mac real-time throughput. VideoToolbox uses Main10 auto-level,
limited-range P010 (10-bit 4:2:0), real-time mode, no frame reordering, and a
one-second maximum keyframe interval. Bitrate is a target, not a strict cap.

PQ defaults: 1920×1080 at 30 fps, a 14-second full-field neutral step sequence,
then a five-second horizontal gradient from 0 to 10000 nits (linear in nits).
Decision 63 steps are 0.05/0.25/0.5/1/2/4/4.926 × 203 nits, held two seconds each:
10.15, 50.75, 101.5, 203, 406, 812, 999.978 nits. Limited luma is
`round(64 + 876 * ST2084(nits/10000))`; neutral chroma is 512. Tags on the pixel
buffers and encoder are BT.2020 / SMPTE ST 2084 / BT.2020 NCL (VUI 9/16/9).
These are source luminances, not claims about panel output or headroom. No
mastering-display or content-light-level SEI metadata is synthesized.
`--seconds` truncates or extends each clip; the final step is held on extension.

JSON manifests contain successful files, dimensions, fps, frame count, actual
compressed-sample average bitrate, requested bitrate, and the profile/tier/level,
chroma format and bit depths read from the encoder's actual `hvcC` configuration.
`levelIDC` is HEVC general_level_idc (e.g. 153 = level 5.1). Refused configurations
include the OSStatus/error; partial files are removed. A partially supported matrix
exits zero and retains the refusal list; no successful clips exits nonzero.
At defaults, target compressed output totals approximately 300 MB, below 2 GB;
custom rates/durations can increase that. Clips are `.mov` with HEVC samples.

## Network sender / receiver contract

```sh
python3 tools/diag/netprobe-send.py HEADSET_IP --mbps 150 --fps 90 --packet-size 1200 --duration 30
python3 tools/diag/netprobe-send.py HEADSET_IP --mode tcp --duration 30
sh tools/diag/pull-diag.sh 'DEVICE NAME OR ID' /tmp/avp-diag-logs
```

Port defaults to 9945; the AVP sink must already be listening. The Python file
uses only the Python 3.9 standard library and also runs on Windows. UDP sends
one burst per frame, pacing from absolute monotonic deadlines. Fractional byte
budgets carry between frames. Packet size is a **maximum UDP payload**; a frame's
budget is distributed over packets so every packet can hold its header. Rate
includes the diagnostic header, excludes UDP/IP/link headers. Overdue frames
are skipped instead of accumulating catch-up bursts; late frames are reported.

Every UDP packet starts with this 28-byte network-byte-order header (`!4sQQIHH`):

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 bytes | ASCII `AVPD`, protocol version defined by this magic |
| 4 | uint64 | Packet sequence, starts at zero per run |
| 12 | uint64 | Sender monotonic nanoseconds immediately before send |
| 20 | uint32 | Frame ID, starts at zero (may skip if sender is late) |
| 24 | uint16 | Packet index within frame, zero based |
| 26 | uint16 | Total packets in frame |
| 28 | bytes | Zero-filled padding to the packet's payload size |

Monotonic clocks on different hosts have different origins. Derive relative
jitter/loss from these fields; absolute one-way latency needs clock alignment.
TCP is deliberately unpaced bulk (ignores rate/fps/packet-size), zero bytes with
no message framing. Its summary `packets` counts send calls, which may be partial,
not TCP segments. JSON summaries report locally accepted bytes, actual elapsed
time, offered Mb/s and late frames; they do not establish receipt/loss at the sink.
Socket timeouts/errors produce a nonzero exit. The puller targets the paired
app's `uk.lumenio.alvr` data container, `Documents/diag`, and preserves logs on device.

## Validation

```sh
/usr/bin/python3 tools/diag/test_netprobe.py
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 tools/diag/test_netprobe.py
sh tools/diag/smoke.sh
sh -n tools/diag/pull-diag.sh
```

Python defaults test the wire header, fractional rate/pacing math, sender loop
with a deterministic clock/socket, and JSON summary without opening sockets.
Optional real TCP/UDP integration tests use loopback only:
`DIAG_LOOPBACK=1 /usr/bin/python3 tools/diag/test_netprobe.py` (repeat with Homebrew).
The smoke script generates three 640×360, 30 fps, one-second clips in a temporary
directory, checks both manifests against the files' actual format descriptions
(Main10, 4:2:0, 10-bit, PQ colour tags, dimensions, level, duration and sample
count), then removes the clips. It fails when encoding or inspection fails.
The same checker can inspect full runs:
`swift tools/diag/check-clips.swift /tmp/avp-hevc/hevc-manifest.json /tmp/avp-pq/pq-manifest.json`.
If the execution sandbox blocks the default Swift module cache, set
`CLANG_MODULE_CACHE_PATH` to a writable scratch directory; smoke does this itself.

Validation in the authoring sandbox (2026-10-21): Python tests passed on both
interpreters (five tests each, two opt-in integrations skipped); shell syntax
passed. Loopback integration was attempted but bind is denied by sandbox policy.
Swift encoder and checker compile, but file smoke **did not pass**: VideoToolbox
only enumerates RGB/JPEG encoders, no HEVC, and creation returns -12908 at every
requested matrix point and 640×360. This is not an AVP decoder limit measurement.
Run the smoke command above outside that restricted environment before use.
The required visionOS Xcode build was attempted; it fails on missing provisioning
profiles and the absent `ALVRClient/ALVRClientCore.xcframework` (the initial default
DerivedData location was also unwritable). No app files were changed.
